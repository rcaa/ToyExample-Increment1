Drawbacks (Annotation-Pointcut-LayeredAspects):

 - The empty concrete aspect for static BT is mandatory to enable the feature code. 
 - The adviceexecution idiom is not generic enough
   - It is mandatory to redine all pointcuts related to around advice explicitly declared
     in the abstract aspect.
 - Manually mark/annotate/idenfify all around advice in the abstract aspect using a custom
   Java 5 annotation.
    
 Benefits of Annotation-Pointcut-LayeredAspects over (LA and If-Pointcut-LA):
 
  + Better source code/bytecode instrumentation and performance.
    + The adviceexecution idiom excludes non-around advice from feature activation/deactivation.
      They are performed by the if pointcuts provided by the redefined pointcuts.
